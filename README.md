complexNumAdder

This program will begin by prompting the user for a file from which to read in
data about complex numbers, and create a matrix from it. The prompt will continue until a valid file is read in.

The user will then be prompted to manually enter a new matrix. 
First the rows and columns must be entered, and then an according amount of complex numbers must be entered.

The user will also be prompted to enter in a single complex number, 
which will be used to display the correctness of many of the programs functions.

At this point the user input is finished and calculations will be made(if possible) and the results will be displayed.

Note: When complex numbers are being input, they can be entered as integers, 
or doubles, and can be a number, or zero. When entering the rows and columns of the second matrix, 
however, please refrain from entering zero.
